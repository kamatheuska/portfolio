# Nicolas Ramirez Portfolio

## About

The idea behind this repository came to me many years ago, when I wanted to become a self taught software developer and figured out that the best way to showcase what I have been learning was to put it somewhere online.

From there, it has been evolving into what you see right now.

During these years I have been developing/embracing/using many CS ideas for this portfolio. In the following lines, I will try to describe those autoimposed patterns, rules and arquitechtures in their current, imperfect state.

That does not mean that these rules cannot change; they are just stepping stones in my continous learning process that I decided to formalize. Please let me know if you see any issues and have a some constructive criticism with which I can surely bring my game further!
