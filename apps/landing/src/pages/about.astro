                        For the past years, I have been working as a developer on an e-commerce company, a
                        startup project on a large corporation, a marketing focused startup and a zero code
                        SaaS startup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although my main focus is in frontend development and its technologies, I was required
                        to do a bit of every rol and have learned a great deal about software development and
                        working in a complex team.
                    </p>

                    <p>The last few years I worked in Fullstack Development roles.</p>

                    <p>
                        I have an artistic background, studying music composition in Berlin in the Musikschule
                        Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg and the UdK Berlin. After a while, artistic endeavour wasn't
                        enough, so I decided to learn to code.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After all this time, I can see how the rigurosity of german music theory influence my
                        love for clean and expresive code.
